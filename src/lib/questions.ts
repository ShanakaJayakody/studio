      'dm_q4_s3': 'yes', // Y - Corrected from no as gloves are garments. The statement means no garments that are black. Premises: "some black gloves". So this statement is false. User answer key is Y, so their interpretation must be that 'garments' doesn't include gloves or something. Given the UCAT style, "garments" usually includes accessories like gloves and hats. Black gloves are mentioned. So "There were no black garments" should be NO. Let me re-check user's answer key NYYYN. For Q4 S3 the answer is Y. This is tricky. "There were no black garments in the suitcase." -- Stimulus says "some black gloves". Gloves are garments. So this statement is False. User says Y. I will follow the user's provided answer Y for now, assuming a specific interpretation.
