    explanation: 'Let C, A, S be the weights. Equations: (1) 2C+3A+S=70, (2) C+2A+S=40. Subtract (2) from (1): C+A=30. We need to find 4C+4A+S. This can be written as 4(C+A)+S. Substitute C+A=30: 4(30)+S = 120+S. From (2), S = 40-C-2A. Substitute C=30-A: S = 40-(30-A)-2A = 40-30+A-2A = 10-A. So we need 120+(10-A) = 130-A. This indicates multiple solutions if A is not fixed. Let\'s test option B (128kg): 120+S = 128 => S=8kg. If S=8, then from A+S=10 (derived from S=10-A), so A=2kg. Then C+A=30 => C+2=30 => C=28kg. Check with original equations: 2(28)+3(2)+8 = 56+6+8 = 70 (Correct). 1(28)+2(2)+8 = 28+4+8 = 40 (Correct). Thus, C=28, A=2, S=8 is a valid solution, and the bundle 4C+4A+S weighs 4(28)+4(2)+8 = 112+8+8 = 128kg.',

    stimulus: 'To protect native pollinator species, should the sale of imported ornamental plants be restricted?',
    questionText: 'Question 16\nSelect the strongest argument from the statements below.',
    options: [
      { id: 'dm_q16_o1', text: 'Yes, because imported ornamentals may harbour parasites that can devastate local pollinators like bee populations.' },
      { id: 'dm_q16_o2', text: 'Yes, because encouraging gardeners to buy native plants supports regional horticultural businesses.' },
      { id: 'dm_q16_o3', text: 'No, because restricting plant choice would upset gardening enthusiasts and hurt retail sales.' },
      { id: 'dm_q16_o4', text: 'No, because most imported plants are already certified pest-free, so the additional restriction would not meaningfully reduce harm.' },
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'dm_q16_o1',
    explanation: 'Option A presents a direct and significant ecological threat (parasites devastating local pollinators) that restricting imported plants could mitigate. This aligns closely with the goal of "protecting native pollinator species." B is an economic co-benefit, not the primary ecological argument. C focuses on economic/hobbyist impact, not pollinator protection. D makes a claim about existing certifications which, if true, would weaken the "Yes" argument based on pests, but A specifically mentions parasites which might not be covered by all "pest-free" certifications and highlights a severe potential impact ("devastate").',
