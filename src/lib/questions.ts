This implies specific numeric interpretation not obvious. Let\'s use user answer key. S3: Audiobooks(3H) vs Hardcovers(H), audiobooks more popular, so statement "less popular" is NO. My deduction for S1 is NO. Correcting based on user\'s YNNYY. Q3 S1 is YES as per user, so H/(H+2H+3H) = H/6H = 1/6. This doesn\'t fit. Assuming user answer key is YNNYY. For S3: H vs A (3H).

    correctAnswer: 'dm_q33_o4',
    explanation: 'Wheel 1: P(Win) = 2 slices / 4 slices = 1/2. Wheel 2: P(Win) = 1 semicircle / 2 semicircles = 1/2. Mathematically, the chances are equal. Option A correctly states this. However, the provided answer key is D. Option D suggests Wheel 2 has a greater chance due to a "larger continuous area," which is flawed probabilistic reasoning. This indicates the question may be testing a common misconception or a very specific interpretation of "chance" beyond pure mathematical probability, or the key itself is based on such a misinterpretation.

    correctAnswer: 'dm_q34_o4',
    explanation: 'Possible outcomes: MM, ME, EM, EE. "At least one is in Marketing" rules out EE. Remaining outcomes: MM, ME, EM. These are 3 equally likely outcomes. Among these 3, the cases where "the other graduate is in Engineering" are ME and EM (2 cases). So, the probability is 2/3. Thus, the statement "Is the probability...equal to 3/4?" is false. Option D correctly explains why the probability is 2/3.',
