    explanation: 'Based on the provided answer key YNNNY. S1: The premises state "Some reptiles are kept as pets" and "All pythons are reptiles". This does not exclude the possibility of a python being kept as a pet. The answer "Yes" implies that the conclusion "Nobody kept as a pet is a python" *does* follow, which is ambiguous. S2: From "No reptile is a mammal" and "All pythons are reptiles", it logically follows that "No python is a mammal". The answer key "No" contradicts this. S3: Whiffles are not mentioned in the premises. S4: The premises do not provide information to support or deny this. S5: If an animal is not a python, it could be another type of reptile (and thus not a mammal), or it could be a mammal. The answer "Yes" (meaning the statement *does* follow) is not strictly deducible. Following the provided key.',
